    <p>An easy crockpot chicken and dumplings recipe for a filling, comforting meal on a cold, snowy day. I have four children who are picky eaters, and they love this!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough</li>
        <li>2 cups water, or as needed to cover</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, condensed soup, onion, and butter in a slow cooker. Add enough water to cover; stir well. Cover and cook on High for 5 to 6 hours.</li>
        <li>About 30 minutes before serving, tear biscuit dough into pieces. Place dough in the slow cooker. Cook until dough is no longer raw in the center.</li>
